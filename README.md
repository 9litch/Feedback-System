##  How to Use:

### Real easy implemenation:

Add these lines to your the view controller (Collection and Table View  Controller works) you want to show the pop in. This will initialise the PopUplauncher to get access to the necessary functions

```swift
 lazy var gitPopLauncher: PopUpLauncher = {
    
        let launcher = PopUpLauncher()
        return launcher
    
    }()

```

### Showing the Pop up.
Just below the lines above or anywhere else withing your View Controller add the function below. 

```swift
  func showPopUp() {
    
        if let window = UIApplication.shared().keyWindow {
    
            gitPopLauncher.showPopUp(roundedViewBackgroundColor: UIColor(red: 60.0/255.0, green:  80.0/255.0 ,blue: 82.0/255.0, alpha: 1.0), informationString: "Oh Hi there.", informationStringTextColor: UIColor.white(), durationOnScreen: 4.5, currentView: window, showsBackgroundGradient: true, isAboveTabBar: false)
        }
        
        
    }

```

In this function we get access the the keyWindow  and use itâ€™s frame to call the showPopUp function located in the PopUplauncher file.
